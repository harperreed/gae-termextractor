This is a super-duper thin Google AppEngine API wrapper around the topia term
extractor.

The short version is, you call it by passing a 'text' parameter (GET or POST)
and an optional 'format' parameter ('xml' or 'json'). Like this:

	http://localhost/terms?text=this+is+the+network+of+our+disconnect

Which would return:

	<rsp stat="ok">
		<terms query="this is the network of our disconnect">
			<term strength="1" occurrence="1" value="network"/>
		</terms>
	</rsp>

Currently, all the dependencies (topia, zope, APIApp) are bundled with this
package. That seems kind of dumb and may change in time. We'll see...
